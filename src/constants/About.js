    "Dream, Direction and Discipline \n\nThese three when put together help me to realize self me. I am a painstaking person who is always ready to put uninterrupted focus and perseverance in doing my work. I am an innovative thinker who most of the time like to think out of the box when needed. I love to first think, then visualize, and then finding the way to shape my visualization.\n\n🚀 Passionate for technology and loves 🌌space more than earth :D. It's because space is full of 🔭mysteries, and I always had the craze inside of me to explore🔍 it.",
